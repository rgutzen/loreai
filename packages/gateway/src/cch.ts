/**
 * Claude Code billing header (`cch`) computation for worker requests.
 *
 * Claude Code OAuth bearer tokens require an `x-anthropic-billing-header`
 * as the first system prompt block. The `cch` field is an xxHash64 of the
 * entire serialized request body, masked to 20 bits (5 hex chars).
 *
 * The standalone Claude binary computes this in custom Zig code injected
 * into nativeFetch. We replicate the algorithm for our worker calls which
 * build requests from scratch and can't piggyback on the binary's signing.
 *
 * Algorithm (from https://a10k.co/b/reverse-engineering-claude-code-cch.html):
 *   1. Build body JSON with `cch=00000` placeholder
 *   2. cch = xxHash64(body_bytes, seed) & 0xFFFFF → 5-char hex
 *   3. Replace `cch=00000` with computed value
 *
 * The seed is a 64-bit constant baked into Claude Code's custom Bun binary.
 * It changes between releases and is not stored as a raw byte pattern —
 * the Zig compiler inlines it into the instruction stream or computes it
 * at comptime, leaving no searchable trace in the binary.
 *
 * We maintain a version→seed mapping. Workers pin their billing header to
 * a version with a known seed so the cch hash is valid. Conversation
 * requests are forwarded as-is with the client's own signed cch.
 *
 * Per-session state: each conversation turn records whether the session
 * uses bearer-token auth (Claude Code OAuth) so workers know to inject
 * the billing header. Keyed by sessionID to prevent cross-session
 * contamination. Mirrors the per-session `sessionAuth` in `auth.ts`.
